Text classification model interpretability demo
==========================

**This code is provided as example only. It is provided without guarantee or level of support.** This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.

This is the demo I presented at my [Cloud Next '19 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHIEZ-Scek8) with [Yufeng](https://twitter.com/yufengg). It shows how to build a bag of words text classification model to tag ML-related Stack Overflow questions, deploy the model to [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/), and interpret it's predictions with [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap). For more details on the SHAP piece of this demo, see my [blog post](https://sararobinson.dev/2019/04/23/interpret-bag-of-words-models-shap.html).

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, create a new [Colab notebook](http://colab.research.google.com) and import the `stackoverflow-classifier.ipynb` file in this repo. The CSV we used for the Stack Overflow training data is public. You'll need to create a Google Cloud project to deploy the model. If you don't want to do that, you'll still be able to run the SHAP code at the end of the notebook.
